			"One of the most difficult aspects of starting a parkour gym is finding an appropriate space and the means to pay for it.  In the interim, there is a lot to be said for equipment that is lightweight, modular, and portable.  I spent three years hauling boxes, rails, and mats back and forth from home to Voyager Academy (thirty miles away), and was considering starting a traveling parkour instruction service out of a van or a panel truck.",
			"In the last year of my teaching at Voyager, I designed and built a set of stackable/nestable vaulting boxes.  They were \"adult sized\" when all four components were together, \"youth sized\" with the top (smallest) section removed, and \"kid sized\" with the bottom (largest) section removed.  Each piece could stand on its own as a sturdy launching/landing box, and various combinations of stacked and separate boxes made for a wide range of teaching and training possibilities, especially when combined with other equipment.",
			"Below is a set of plans I created for the benefit of Carolina Gym Supply, a mat manufacturing company that built a great deal of custom equipment for me, based off designs we cooked up together.  If I were to change one thing about these plans, it would be to increase the angling of the sides from 7.5 degrees up to 12 or 15, to reduce the risk of tipping from moderate to slight."
