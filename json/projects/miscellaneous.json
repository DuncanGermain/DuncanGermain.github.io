		"blurb": "In 2011, my friend Stephanie introduced me to the concept of sculpting by laying down layers of hot glue in a sort of 3D printing.  Using string and paperclips to create a wireframe skeleton, I sculpted a traceur performing a speed vault and skinned it with black airsoft pellets.  More of this method can be seen incorporated into the Jace costume on the Apparel page.",
