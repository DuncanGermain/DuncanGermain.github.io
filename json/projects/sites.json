			"Although I lack formal training in both graphic design and web design, my self-taught experience with graphic design goes back much farther than my self-taught coding skills.  Both of the mock-ups shown below were created using Inkscape (a vector graphics program), with some of the artwork coming from Seashore (a Mac version of paint).",
			"The first two are alternate versions of a landing page for a parkour business I was working on with a friend in North Carolina in 2011; the rest are pages, subpages, and resources I created while volunteering at Parkour Visions in Washington state in 2013.  Since they were both for the same kind of audience, I recycled certain elements in both designs, and as you can see, I kept the wood-border look for my own personal site."
