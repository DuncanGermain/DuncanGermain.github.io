			"There is significant value in having a plug-and-play curriculum.  As long as you don't force your coaches to adhere to it mindlessly, it can provide some much-needed consistency between classes, ensure a minimum of quality, and contribute significantly to the development of a gym culture.  It can also often serve as a spur to creativity, since it tends to be easier to come up with an alternate, contrasting idea than to invent a creative class from scratch.",
			"In this document, we outlined in detail both the one-day and the three-day curriculae.  The next step would have been to create similarly detailed outlines for the six- and twelve-day sessions, leaving coaches the freedom to mix and match for anything in between.  Unfortunately, though, I left the gym before we had time to finish the entire framework."
