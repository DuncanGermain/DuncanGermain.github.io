			"These were a subtle touch (I don't think anyone noticed), but I was disproportionately pleased to have them.",
			"Right side.  I really like the \"brushed\" look of the clear coat.",
			"Left side.  The lettering was done with stickers, carefully applied and then outlined with black Sharpie.",
			"Front view.  The stripes are actually just electrical tape (even the white).  I spent nearly an hour getting them lined up and cut correctly.",
			"Top view.  You can see the taper of the central orange stripe, as well as the cuts that allowed the stripes to conform to the contours of the ventilation holes.",
			"Insignia!  This dragon was designed by my friend Stephanie.  I used a grid and Sharpies to transfer it onto an 8.5\"x11\" Shrinky Dink, which shrunk in the oven down to about 2.5\" wide.  I burned my fingers pressing it against the helmet while it was still hotâ€”I had to get it to conform to the slight curve before it stiffened.",
			"Close-up of the lettering.  I made a small mistake with the stickers, and, in the process of trying to correct it, ended up with a really cool distressed pattern.  It made me think of battle scars and blaster burns, so I didn't bother repainting it.",
			"Close-up of the hexagons.  These were done with painter's tape and a razor blade, followed by spray-painting with orange paint.  It was quite a challenge to get the taper correct, but I'm fairly happy with how it came out.",
			"The whole ensemble.  I didn't win the obstacle course competition, but that was due to my own technique, not the costume."
