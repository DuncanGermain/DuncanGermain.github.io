			"The process of making an award is much simpler than most people think.  I bought paper and seals at Office Max, downloaded a few fonts, typed up an appropriate sentiment, and printed it off.  Voil√†!  Because my hand has a tattoo reading \"What would Ender do?\", the term had meaning even for those of my students who had never read the book."

			"Typically, I had about five recipients per year for the Ender Award, which was more about character than about any specific achievement.",
			"Looking back on old pieces of writing, I almost always feel that I went overboard with earnestness and effusiveness.  In this case, though, it still feels appropriate."
