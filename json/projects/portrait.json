			"It's an agent!  I did all of my sketching off of photographs, since I didn't have the skill for live modeling, and even so, I had a hard time convincing myself that Hugo Weaving's forehead really did go up that high.

			"My only commissionâ€”Tim, the RA from my best friend's dorm hall at the School of Science and Math.",
			"Probably my most true-to-life portrait, of my senior-year roommate Justin.",
			"Part of my application to the Cooper Union school of architecture.  The whole application was practical, with this part being to draw two self portraits, the right one \"without reference to body.\"",
			"One of my favorite students at Lee Brothers Tae Kwon Do academy, a silent but extremely diligent and focused boy named Josh."
