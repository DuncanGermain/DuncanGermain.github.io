			"One of the greatest sadnesses of leaving Seattle was that I would no longer have access to an incredibly wide range of modular equipment.  Frankentwix was one of my attempts to cheat, walking away with much more potential-per-pound than any one piece of equipment has the right to contain."

			"Interior construction.  The walls are angled at 15 degrees from vertical, and the inner supports are 2\"x8\", trimmed with a table saw and a circular chop saw.  The baseboard is 3/4\" ACX plywood, as are the outer panels.",
			"Wood glue and a few 3\" deck screws are enough to tie each vertical support to the baseboard and outer panels.",
			"To install the bar, I first cut the channel for it using a hole saw, then stuck the bar in and drilled downward from the top.  I used 4\" lag screws and liquid nails to lock it in.",
			"Bar installation cont'd.  I didn't bother cutting the metal short, since it was going to be hidden within the box part anyway.  As it turns out, leaving those last few inches of steel helped balance the thing so that it stays perfectly level if you pick it up by the bar closest to the center.",
			"The finished product, roughly 8\" high and 4' long.  There's 3/4\" rubber matting on the bottom and inlaid in the \"stride post,\" attached with liquid nails and drywall screws with a nice, wide head."
